# Medical Website Starter (GitHub Pages Ready)

This is a minimal, static medical clinic site scaffold that works out-of-the-box on **GitHub Pages**.

## How to use
1. Create a public repo (e.g. `medical123`).
2. Upload these files at the **root** of the repo (index.html alongside `css/`, `js/`, `img/`).
3. Enable **Settings → Pages** → Source: *Deploy from a branch* → Branch: `main` → Folder: `/ (root)`.
4. Visit `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

All asset paths are **relative** (`./css/style.css`, `./js/main.js`, `./img/...`) so it will work for any project-site repo name.
